//define a function named main that receives no argument values
main()
{//statements of main are enclosed in braces
    printf("hello, world\n");//main calls library function printf to print this sequence of characters; \n represents the newline character
}
// The \ is an escape character which will allow you to do special things in your program. \n is new line \\ alows you to put the actual \ in the program and \" will let you use double quote in the text without messing up the program.
